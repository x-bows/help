in driver mode, driver is running and add a new layer, now we have 5 layers
        1. default layer        Fn + F9
        2. custom layer_1       Fn + F10
        3. custom layer_2       Fn + F11
        4. custom layer_3       Fn + F12
        5. driver layer         Fn + F9

1. X-BOWS will turn to driver layer automatically when driver is running
2. we use Fn + F9 to be a switch to choose default layer or driver layer
